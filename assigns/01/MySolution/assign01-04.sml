Please recall the following question in Assign00:
Assign00-04: 10 points
Please implement a function that converts a given
string to an integer:
fun str2int(cs: string): int
In particular, it is expected that str2int(int2str(x)) = x
//
This time you are asked to implement the following
function that only turns a legal representation of an integer
into an integer. By a legal representation of an integer, we
mean a string consisting of a non-empty sequence of digits (where
the digit '0' can be a leading digit).
//
fun str2int_opt(cs: string): int option
//
*)
